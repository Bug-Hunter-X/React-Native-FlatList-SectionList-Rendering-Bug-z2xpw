# React Native FlatList/SectionList Rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native where FlatLists or SectionLists fail to render correctly or update their contents after data changes.  This can lead to blank spaces, missing items, or stale data being displayed.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic implementation. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that addresses the rendering issue.

The primary cause is often related to improper key extraction, asynchronous data updates, or performance bottlenecks.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app on an emulator or device.
4. Observe the rendering anomalies.

## Solution

The solution file demonstrates how to fix this issue using appropriate key extraction, efficient data handling, and optimized rendering techniques.
